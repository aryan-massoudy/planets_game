# planets_game
A simple and interactive simulation game where players can: create and manage planets, build structures and settle people on planets. The code uses the Python OOP paradigm.

This code is a simulation game framework where players can:
Create and manage planets: Each planet has a name, resources (food, wood, stone, gold), and a population. Players can build structures and add humans to the planet.
Build structures: Different types of buildings (e.g., Town Hall, Farm) can be constructed using the planet's resources. A Town Hall is required to add humans.
Add humans: Create and add humans with specific attributes (name, age, profession) to planets. Each human consumes 100 units of food when added, and adding humans is only possible if a Town Hall exists on the planet.
Interact via a menu: The MainMenu class allows players to:
Create new planets.
Build structures on existing planets.
Add humans to planets.
View and manage existing planets.
Exit the game.
The game emphasizes resource management (food, wood, stone, gold) and progression through building and populating planets.
